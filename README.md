# Set up
1. clone this to your local machine/GPU training server
2. set up a python virtualenv and install Tensorflow, following directions here: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/0.6.0/get_started/os_setup.html#virtualenv_install. 
Make sure to choose the right install package(for local test, use Mac-OSX with CPU, when install to server/gpu-enabled machine, use GPU install). 
3. Installing Kera https://github.com/fchollet/keras. Follow the instructions to configure TensorFlow as the backend for Kera. 
4. Follow the CNN Tutorial here(https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/0.6.0/tutorials/deep_cnn/index.html) to train a sample CNN on CIFAR-10. 
5. Optional: Go through the CNN tutorial on here: http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/
